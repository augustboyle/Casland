Cas9 landscapes for binding and scission of off-target sequences

List the ddGs of binding and scission for all off-target types characterized by [Boyle, Becker, Bai, et al. 2021](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe5496) in Science Advances.

To run, simply enter the perfect target sequence along with the path to the reference table and a request for either binding or scission parameters.

`python list_ddG_perturbations.py --ddG_table S17_F7C_ddG_perturbation.tsv <target sequence> {binding,scission}`
